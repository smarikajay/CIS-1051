Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

Learned how to use file and import our code into VS code and implement flask. We have got the website and are now trying to add in the interactive elements and make it more appealing to the eye. We have a logo and have identified what options we want the user to have.

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

The finer details, found/created a database for the specific recipes we want to put in for each category. This shouldn't be too hard though as we have the categories picked out. We also haven't made the youtube video yet, but that will come in the next few days.

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

Mainly, with VS code, and as each of us have different laptop interfaces it was challenging to get our code to properly input in, but we were able to watch some youtube videos and figure it out.
