# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

RecipeWhiz

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

The website will allow you to search for recipes based on the food items you input in, such as the ingredients you have left over in your fridge which will then go against a database to see what dishes you can prepare.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

The generator will allow the user to input their given ingredients into a search button, and then output a list of random recipes or dishes that contain those ingredients. We will import specific modules like flask and requests. The program will incorporate multiple functions that will allow it to read through a recipe database using a Food and Recipe API, and use the reques function to retrieve the desired information from the API. Then we will use the Flask framework to create our website with Python, and design it with HTML and CSS and host our website with PythonAnywhere.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

TA for all: Amirhossein Baghghadam
Michael Pham - michael.pham@temple.edu
Jared Segal - jared.segal@temple.edu

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

Gain more experience with programming as this is my first ever coding class, and in this case programming real applications in different languages. And we accomplish the task hopefully be able to put it on our resume's and share with others.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Become more comfortable with programming and in the new language and get to the point of at least adding in the database portion as well as some of the interactive features.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Successfully create an interactive recipe generator website that runs smoothly and is useful to many.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

As we are at a good level with python right now we hope to research and learn HTML and CSS to fully create the website. We will use HTML to create the content of the page like headings, and then use CSS to design the colors, fonts, etc. Then we will have to install and understand the Flask Framework and set up a virtual environment to connect our Python backend to out frontend with HTML and CSS. And then we will learn to use PythonAnywhere to host our flask application. To accomplish all this we will research using the following platforms: Stack Overflow, GitHub, Reddit, and Youtube.
